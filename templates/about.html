    <h2>My Background in Information Systems:</h2>

    <!-- This is really how I ended up In IS. -->
    <p>The reason I chose to go into Information Systems is because I always thought I'd study business, but
    took a programming course in my senior year of high school. Once I started that course, there was no turning
    back. I had to incorporate technology into my studies. Here are some languages I've taken courses on:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C++</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I've had a few internships—one as a Process Engineer and the other in Employer Relations—but I'm ready to
    start the next chapter of my life. I've started to look for my first job out of college. Here are some roles I'm
    looking for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Systems Analyst</li>
        <li>SQL Developer</li>
        <li>Application Developer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Here are some Information Systems courses I've taken at UMD:</h2>
